      <p> Open-minded globetrotter, I'm not afraid of adventure. From Uzbekistan to Belize, I have visited more than thirty countries around the world. Former exchange student in South Korea, Australia, and many other places in Europe, I also have an international exposure through my studies.</p>
      <p>At ease with foreign languages, my numerous trips and my international studies allowed me to learn to communicate and work with teams from all over the world.</p>
      <p>Far from being shy, speaking in public in a foreign language is not a problem for me.</p>

      <p> Working in a team is not always easy, but it always goes well. You need to know how to find your place, take the time to listen while remaining efficient. And it is also really important to question yourself.</p> 
      <p>My role is often to help making decisions. Some call me the "time keeper" and I am often entrusted with the last proofreading. I don't like to talk about leadership, because I think that every proactive person in a group is a form of leader.</p>
      <p>A job well done, on time, without free-riders: that's what I consider a successful group work!</p>

      <p> Challenge is a word I love. When it comes to motivation, the challenge is my driver. Passionate about escape games, I love solving problems and challenging myself. Very creative, I also like to create my own games for my friends.</p>
      <p>Naturally curious, I am an independent person who seeks to learn and discover for myself. If a line of code resists me, I can search for a long time rather than giving up. However, I'm not afraid to ask for help when I really need it.</p>
      <p>This website is an example which testifies of my motivation and ability to learn fast.</p>

        <h3>Hi! I am Garance!</h3>
        <p>I graduated from a bachelor in International Management of Hospitality (Institut Paul Bocuse) last year, and I'm currently enrolled as a student of MSc in Digital Marketing & Data Science at Emlyon Business School. Passionate about air transport, I specialized in revenue management, as it is a nice gateway between hospitality and airlines. Then, I chose to pursue studies in data analytics in order to consolidate my profile as an analyst and revenue manager.</p>
        <p>Since the beginning of my MSc, my project has evolved and right now, I want to dig deeper into the 'data world'. If Airlines and Airports are still my biggest dream, both the actual context and the new horizon of data makes me want to seek for a data related position rather than to pursue an industry focus recruitment.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am finalizing my third semester remotely, and I am looking for a data related position (six months internship or working contract)</p>

      <h3>Student Council Associate</h3>
      <p><i>Solbridge - South Korea</i></p>
      <br>
      <p> After two weeks of recruitment, I was chosen by the Student Council to become an associate. This role consists in ensuring logistic, organization and communication of the various events of the school.</p>
      <p>During my semester at SolBridge, we organized no less than five cultural trips across South Korea, and more than a dozen events for the school. From sporting events to artistic Talent Show, our Council was very proactive and it was extremely fun to be part of the adventure.</p>
      <p>One of my fondest memories of this semester is to have been chosen Master of Ceremony for the Graduation party. With a twist of ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’, we welcomed around 300 guests for an unforgettable night.</p>

      <h3>Volunteer</h3>
      <p><i>Geriatric Hospital</i></p>
      <br>
      <p> Thanks to my high school, I had the chance to participate in this touching inter-generational exchange project. The principle is simple: every week at lunchtime, student volunteers go to the geriatric hospital of Fourvière to spend a special time with an elderly person.</p>
      <p>Thanks to this project, I met an incredible person, whom I had the pleasure of meeting every week for a walk in the park, a birthday cake, a piano session, and many other special moments. This lonely person had no other visits, and coming so often with other students, we realized the distress and loneliness of some of our elders.</p>
      <p>This great experience taught me to take more time for my own grandparents and for seniors in general.</p>
