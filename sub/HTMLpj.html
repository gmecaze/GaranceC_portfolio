    <p>HTML/CSS3 are not skills expected for a data analyst. However, I find it pretty cool to be able to design your own website on your own.</p>

          <p>To understand this project you need to know that it is my 'crashtest'. Indeed, I wanted to make an online portefolio of my projects for a while when I had my first and only two hours bootcamp of HTML. The idea came quite fast, but I tought that it was ambitious and probably difficult. However, I was in quarantine (mai 2020) and I had (almost) nothing else to do.</p>
          <br>
          <p>  A week after, I am standing in front of my laptop with a a very proud smile, and while I'm deploying it, I can't help thinking of all the things I have learned  in a week... </p>
          <br>
          <p>If you are reading this, it means that you have at least made three clicks on this website, and I hope you liked it so far. It isn't perfect, I know. But what is? I can't wait to improve it, add content, and make it live. Also, if you have any comment, feedback or tip, feel free to contact me on Linkedin! <p style="font-size:30px">  &#128521;</p> <p><br> Until then, enjoy ! </p>

          <p>This is my second project using HTML. It is not finished yet, but it will be soon and I can't wait to share it with you!</p>
          <br>
          <p> During the quarantine, the government closed public markets and many farmers and market workers found themselves without distribution channels. My little brother and his friends therefore decided to set up an associative project of fruit and vegetable deliveries. As people had trouble finding them in supermarkets, their association was a real success. Today, as confinement ends, their clients ask them to continue. Therefore, I proposed to create a website for their non-profit.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We are working on it jointly and it is really interesting to develop a website for an actual business. I am very exited by the project and I can't wait to share the final result!</p>
